## Work Process 💪:

As a programmer, I follow a systematic and efficient work process that allows me to deliver high-quality software solutions. Here's a glimpse into my typical workflow:

Understanding the requirements: I begin by thoroughly understanding the project requirements, ensuring clarity and alignment with stakeholders.

### Design and planning: 

I carefully design the architecture and plan the implementation strategy, considering scalability, maintainability, and performance.

### Coding: 

With the plan in place, I dive into coding, leveraging my expertise in various programming languages and frameworks. I maintain clean and readable code, following industry best practices and coding standards.

### Testing and debugging: 

Quality is of utmost importance to me, so I extensively test my code, using both manual and automated testing techniques. I pay attention to edge cases and handle exceptions gracefully, ensuring a robust and reliable application.

### Collaboration and version control: 

Throughout the development process, I actively engage in collaboration, working alongside other team members, sharing ideas, and leveraging version control systems like Git to manage code changes effectively.

### Documentation: 

I believe in the power of well-documented code. I ensure that my projects are accompanied by clear and comprehensive documentation, making it easier for other developers to understand and contribute.

### Continuous learning: 

Technology is constantly evolving, and I embrace this by continuously updating my skills and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends. I enjoy learning new languages, frameworks, and tools that can enhance my development process.

## Commits ✅:

My commits in projects are made using the following formula:

		git commit -m '[EMOJI SEMANTIC]: description message'

Where ```SEMANTIC``` and ```EMOJI``` refer to the character of the commit, following the pattern of the documentation below:

### Semantics 💭:

- **[TEST]**: Is related to testing changes or adding new tests to the codebase.
- **[DOCS]**: Involves documentation changes, such as updating or adding documentation.
- **[PERF]**: Focuses on performance improvements in the code.
- **[CHORE]**: Includes changes that are related to general maintenance tasks, such as updating dependencies or configuring build tools.
- **[STYLE]**: Pertains to code style changes, such as formatting or renaming variables.
- **[BUILD]**: Involves modifications to the build system or external dependencies.
- **[FIX]**: Addresses bug fixes or resolves issues in the codebase.
- **[REFACTOR]**: Involves refactoring the code, meaning restructuring or optimizing it without adding new features or fixing bugs.
- **[FEAT]**: Introduces new features or implements significant changes to the codebase.

## Development Process ⚙️:

Developers used [Trello]() to get things organized, each one using their own branch to code, using names to identify the commit type then merginng the features into develop branch. After testing, the group update the main branch. This application was developed in xx/xx/20xx until xx/xx/20xx.
