## Work Process 💪:

As a programmer, I follow a systematic and efficient work process that allows me to deliver high-quality software solutions. Here's a glimpse into my typical workflow:

## Commits ✅:

My commits in projects are made using the following formula:

	git commit -m '[EMOJI SEMANTIC]: description message'

Where ```SEMANTIC``` and ```EMOJI``` refer to the character of the commit, following the pattern of the documentation below:

### Semantics 💭:

- **[TEST]**: Is related to testing changes or adding new tests to the codebase.
- **[DOCS]**: Involves documentation changes, such as updating or adding documentation.
- **[PERF]**: Focuses on performance improvements in the code.
- **[CHORE]**: Includes changes that are related to general maintenance tasks, such as updating dependencies or configuring build tools.
- **[STYLE]**: Pertains to code style changes, such as formatting or renaming variables.
- **[BUILD]**: Involves modifications to the build system or external dependencies.
- **[FIX]**: Addresses bug fixes or resolves issues in the codebase.
- **[REFACTOR]**: Involves refactoring the code, meaning restructuring or optimizing it without adding new features or fixing bugs.
- **[FEAT]**: Introduces new features or implements significant changes to the codebase.
